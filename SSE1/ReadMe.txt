| Simple Service Example #1 |
-----------------------------

An Example of an Application using a simple Authentication.
The Service consists of an HTTP Server and a MySQL Database storing all the
Data. Database must be created separately. When the Server is started, all
missing Tables are created automatically. Initialization SQL Scripts do not
create Indices. For simplicity, passwords are not protected by Hash Sums.
